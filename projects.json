    "description": "Indie Photographers is a hub for well, indie photographers. The app is a PWA created through create-react-app. The frontend is a React app with Material-UI on top. The backend is mostly a node RESTful API with Express on top and MongoDB for a database. It's important to mention that this is a concept app not an actual commercial product. Nevertheless, this is a perfect showcase and reflection of my skills at this point in my career.",

    "description": "This is the Website you're currently on. It was created using Gatsby and is purely a static website. You may think the design is minimal because I got lazy and I'm not a great web designer. And you'd be partially correct. But, I got better reasoning behind the minimal design. The website is built with speed and performance in mind. The project is stylized purely using SCSS. No external UI libraries were used.",
