It's August, the weather couldn't be worse. We're still on lockdown, I'm contemplating my plans for the next year. But I only have
one thing on my mind, military service. I feel as if my life is on halt. I can't commit to any plans because I know I'll have to
abandon them next year. I had plans for this summer too which were mainly to find an internship, I thought it'd be a lot of studying
and problem solving but it turned out to be more of a rejection and ghosting experience. I'm fighting among my peers for slave
labour and I can't even get it. Imposter syndrome hits hard sometimes, but even most of my more qualified peers are also sharing my
exact same struggle. This was my last summer as a free man and I can't help but feel the guilt that I have wasted it. I know I
haven't wasted it, I've accumulated more knowledge this summer than I did my whole life, still I feel like I'm missing out.

## Internship hunting

I've been ghosted so many times that it'd put horror movies to shame. I've been lucky enough to make it into a couple of interviews
only to be ghosted once more after the interview without any feedback. My skin has grown thicker no doubt about that, but it still
hurts everytime. I just wish employers would communicate more when asked for feedback just so I could improve better on my next try.
The learning experience is stagnating significantly due to this lack of communication.

The bar for entry is raised unrealistically high for internships in Egypt. Interns are expected to be unpaid juniors instead of
learning students. This mainly stems from the stinginess of opportunities for interns. Most internships are based in Cairo, where
employers usually wouldn't employ interns from external provinces, maybe juniors but almost always never interns. I have resorted to
desperate measures to hide my residence on my resume just to get a shot, although I admittedly had a couple of awkward screenings
that went like "So you don't reside in Cairo, huh?". I never said my methods were the best but I usually wouldn't get a shot
otherwise.

I wish I could blame it on the pandemic but I know most of this is on me.

## Mandatory military service

One of the biggest mysteries to me is why such a system is still in place to this day. I have never met anyone who couldn't wait to
lose his "freedom" and sell canned food for the army for 1 - 3 years. Everyone sees this as a waste of time and resources yet, we
never talk about it publicly. Those who want to serve their countries by bearing arms already volunteer in abundance, so much so
that most of them get rejected.

I'm stuck feeling like my destiny isn't of my own making and I have to give up because none of it matters. My life will be suspended
for a few years (hopefully only one or better none). I do not wish to bear arms ever in my life and would try my hardest to keep it
this way.

## Toxicity among the youth

Young men in Egypt would accept any criticism unless it's concerning their country, their religion, their beliefs, their family,
their favourite TV host.. Argument is a bad word in Egypt. We can't disagree on any issue, there's only one true way that goes with
the Social Valuesâ„¢ whatever that is. Liberty in Egypt is discussing cooking recipes without altering the ingredients.
You'd think that's some old way of thinking, a boomer way of thinking if I may, but no, that's how most of the youth are still
thinking despite years of education and globalization.

Youth in Egypt are accustomed to Football culture and its tribal mentality, "winning" an argument is scoring as many goals as
possible. Seldom is anyone arguing to see the other side's perspective. It's always just to prove them wrong and that's it, leading
to some of the most toxic conversations you could ever be a part of.
